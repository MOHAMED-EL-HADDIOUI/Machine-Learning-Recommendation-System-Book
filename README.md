# **Book Recommendation System**

## **Overview**

This project implements a **Book Recommendation System** that recommends books based on the content of their titles, authors, and publishers. It uses a combination of **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)** for feature extraction and **Annoy (Approximate Nearest Neighbors)** for fast similarity searching. The system can recommend books similar to a given one, based on textual features like book title, author, and publisher.

## **Installation**

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/book-recommendation-system.git
    cd book-recommendation-system
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # For Unix/macOS
    env\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
    ```

3. **Install the Required Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Install Annoy**:
    Annoy is a library used for fast nearest neighbor search.
    ```bash

## **Features**

- **Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the book dataset by combining the title, author, and publisher into a single text feature.
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts book textual features into a numerical format using TF-IDF.
- **Annoy Index**: Builds an efficient index for fast book similarity searching using angular distance.
- **Recommendations**: Recommends similar books to a given ISBN using the Annoy index.

## **Usage**

1. **Preprocessing Data**:
    To preprocess the book dataset, run the following code inside `book_recommendation.py`:
    ```python
    books_ = preprocess_data(books)
    ```

2. **Creating the TF-IDF Matrix**:
    Create a TF-IDF matrix for book features:
    ```python
    tfidf_matrix, tfidf_vectorizer = create_tfidf_matrix(books_)
    ```

3. **Building the Annoy Index**:
    Build the Annoy index for fast recommendations:
    ```python
    annoy_index = build_annoy_index(tfidf_matrix)
    ```

4. **Saving the Preprocessed Data and Models**:
    You can save the preprocessed data, Annoy index, and TF-IDF vectorizer for future use:
    ```python
    save_annoy_index(annoy_index, 'models/annoy_index.ann')
    save_tfidf_vectorizer(tfidf_vectorizer, 'models/tfidf_vectorizer.pkl')
    books_.to_csv('data/preprocessed_books.csv', index=False)
    ```

5. **Recommending Similar Books**:
    Use the following command to get book recommendations based on a specific ISBN:
    ```python
    similar_books = recommend_similar_books_annoy(isbn, books_, annoy_index, n=5)
    ```

6. **Example**:
    ```python
    isbn = "0312195516"
    recommendations = recommend_similar_books_annoy(isbn, books_, annoy_index, n=5)
    for book in recommendations:
        print(book)
    ```

## **Preprocessing**

- The dataset is cleaned by filling missing values for book titles, authors, and publishers with the placeholder "Unknown".
- Features for each book are created by concatenating the title, author, and publisher into a single string.

## **Recommendation System**

- **TF-IDF** is used to transform book features into a matrix of numerical values representing the importance of words.
- **Annoy** builds an index for fast search based on angular distance, which is similar to cosine similarity. This allows for quick retrieval of books that are similar to a given one.

## **Model Persistence**

- The **Annoy index** and **TF-IDF vectorizer** can be saved to disk and reloaded later to avoid rebuilding the index and vectorizer from scratch every time.
- The `annoy_index.ann` and `tfidf_vectorizer.pkl` files contain the saved index and vectorizer.
